\chapter*{Publications}

This chapter is only relevant for PhD theses. It should be removed for all other types of thesis. The chapter lists the publications of the author of the thesis. It can start with a list of prices that the student won. Then, the list of publications can follow. The sections within this chapter are only suggestions and can be structured differently. It might be a good idea to keep the paper references short because of two reasons: 1) it declutters this chapter and keeps it short and informative, and 2) short references within this chapter allow the author to cite the papers here which will make them appear in the bibliography although they might not be directly linked to the thesis.
