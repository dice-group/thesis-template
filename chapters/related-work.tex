\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:related-work}

Within this chapter, the related work should be described. It typically starts with a description of the area of research. Maybe the area can be separated into several sub-fields. In that case, it makes sense to go through the single fields and describe the important and latest developments. It should be noted that a this chapter is not only important for the student to show that they have knowledge about the area of research. It is also important to be able to describe in which sub-field the approach described within this thesis is located. If related work is very similar to the suggested approach, it is important to clearly point out the differences between existing approaches and the approach presented in this thesis.
