\chapter{Approach}
\label{ch:approach}

Within this chapter, the approach is described. It should be noted that the description should focus on the theory of the approach. It is expected that the student is able to explain the approach in a formal and general way.

A common misunderstanding with respect to this chapter is that the author focusses too much on the implementation and the exact use case for which the approach has been written. However, details like the programming language, programming libraries which have been used or the dataset on which the program has been executed to get evaluation results will follow in the next chapters.
