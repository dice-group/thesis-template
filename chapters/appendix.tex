\chapter{Appendix}

The appendix is a good place to put additional content that does not fit into the main text of the thesis, but is too important to be left out. For example, additional evaluation results which would have flodded the evaluation chapter can go here. This may also be a good place for a detailed description of certain file formats, if these formats had some influence on the thesis.
