\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

This is the introduction chapter. It motivates the research problem the thesis looks at. Near the end of this chapter, the contributions of the thesis should be listed. The last paragraph is typically an overview over the thesis' structure.

Here is just some sample content to trigger some of the template's functionality: \gls{rdf}~\cite{rdfprimer} is great. It makes use of \glspl{iri}~\cite{rfc3987}. If we repeat the terms, they well be abbreviated: \gls{rdf}, \gls{iri}. example \glspl{iri} are \iri{rdf}{type} or \iri{rdfs}{domain}. The latter comes from the \gls{rdfs} vocabulary~\cite{rdfs1.1}.
