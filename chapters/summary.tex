\chapter{Summary}
\label{ch:summary}

This is the last chapter of the thesis. It should summarize the research challenge that has been tackled, the proposed approach and the result of the evaluation. The last part of this chapter should contain a look into the future. This can point to gaps that have been left open (e.g., because of the limited time) and new questions which arise based on the gained insights.
